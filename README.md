# IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-KNN-PCA

This project implements an image classification system utilizing two fundamental machine learning techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification. The primary objective is to build an efficient and effective image classifier, particularly suitable for datasets where high-dimensional image data could otherwise pose computational challenges.

The process begins with applying PCA to the image dataset. This crucial step transforms the high-dimensional image pixels into a lower-dimensional feature space while preserving the most significant variance, thereby capturing the essential information and reducing noise. This dimensionality reduction not only speeds up subsequent computations but also helps in mitigating the "curse of dimensionality," which can be problematic for many machine learning algorithms.

Following the feature extraction with PCA, the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is employed for the classification task. KNN classifies new, unseen images based on the majority class of its 'K' closest neighbors in the reduced feature space. The simplicity and effectiveness of KNN, especially on well-preprocessed data, make it a strong candidate for this classification task. This project provides a clear pipeline for image classification, demonstrating how classic machine learning algorithms can be effectively combined for computer vision tasks.
